Rule Templates for your Discord Server. 

**__Rules__**
All rules within this server must be upheld at all times. Warnings will be given out most of the time unless under strict circumstances. Thank you and lets keep our community safe!

**1. Be respectful**
This means no mean, rude, or harassing comments. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

**2. No spamming**
Do not send a lot of small messages right after each other. These disrupt chat and make it hard to scroll through the server. Please keep your messages at least 5 words long while chatting.

**3. No pornographic/adult/other NSFW material**
The idea behind the server is to provide a safe place for us to share art, videos, and other kinds of creative material – not to share the aforementioned NSFW material.

**4. No advertisements**
No invasive advertising, whether it be for other communities or streams. You can post your content in the media channel if it’s relevant and provides actual value for the community.

**5. No offensive names and profile pictures**
Keep your names and profile picture appropriate 

**6. Threats are forbidden**
Threats are prohibited and disallowed.

**7. Don’t share your personal information**
Do not share your personal information or the personal information of other users without their consent. This includes phone numbers, addresses, and any other sensitive information.

**8. Don’t share illegal or pirated content **
Do not share links to illegal or pirated content, such as copyrighted material or stolen software. This is against the Discord terms of service and can result in a ban from the server.

**9. Avoid false or misleading information**
Make sure to fact-check any information that you share and only share reliable sources. Spreading false or misleading information can be harmful and undermines the trust and integrity of the community.

**10. Follow the channel-specific guidelines**
Each channel in your server should have specific guidelines for the type of content that is allowed. Make sure to follow these guidelines and respect the purpose of each channel.
